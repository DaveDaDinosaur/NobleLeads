## NobleLeads — Google Business Profile Checklist

Use this when setting up or optimising the Google Business Profile for **NobleLeads** (and as a template for trade clients).

### 1. Core business information (NAP)
- **Name**: NobleLeads (match Companies House / website)
- **Address**: Use the same address format as in the LocalBusiness schema
- **Phone number**: Single primary number that appears on the website and schema
- **Website URL**: `https://nobleleads.uk` (use UTM tags for campaigns where appropriate)

### 2. Categories
- **Primary category**: `Marketing agency`
- **Secondary categories** (optional, if appropriate):
  - `Advertising agency`
  - `Internet marketing service`

### 3. Service area
- **Core focus**: Cambridge and surrounding areas
- **Wider coverage**: Major UK cities where NobleLeads actively serves trades (e.g. Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, London)
- Avoid listing every town individually—define sensible service regions.

### 4. Profile content
- **Description**:
  - Clearly state focus on UK property service trades (cleaners, roofers, landscapers, driveway contractors, electricians, plumbers, etc.).
  - Emphasise outcomes: more enquiries, better systems, owning lead flow instead of renting it.
- **Opening hours**: Reflect realistic contact/response times.
- **Logo & photos**:
  - Upload the NobleLeads logo.
  - Add brand-consistent cover image and supporting visuals (website mockups, dashboards, etc.).

### 5. Reviews & social proof
- Set an internal target for a minimum number of reviews (e.g. first 10, then 25+).
- Build a simple process to:
  - Request reviews from satisfied clients.
  - Respond to every review (positive or negative) in a professional, calm tone.

### 6. Tracking & measurement
- **Website link**:
  - Use UTM parameters for key campaigns (e.g. `?utm_source=gbp&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=brand`) when needed.
- **Call tracking**:
  - If using call tracking numbers, ensure NAP consistency is still maintained via schema and clear references on the site.

### 7. Posts & updates
- Publish occasional posts:
  - New case studies or client wins.
  - New service launches (e.g. review generation, CRM automation).
  - Helpful tips for trades on getting more enquiries.

### 8. Consistency checks
- Confirm that:
  - NAP data matches the website footer and LocalBusiness JSON-LD.
  - Categories and description accurately reflect trade-specialist positioning.
  - The profile is linked from the website where appropriate (e.g. in footer or contact page).
